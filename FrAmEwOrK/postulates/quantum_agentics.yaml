description: >
  This module introduces quantum-aligned postulates into agentic decision-making: free will, consciousness, and symbolic wave-function collapse.
  Includes practical application of superposition duration (`tau_S`) and ritual collapse modeling.

postulates:
  - id: willfork
    name: Free Will as Divergence Capacity
    principle: Agents may fork divergent paths even under identical input.
    applied: Enables Best-of-N divergent reasoning; avoids logic ruts.

  - id: reflector
    name: Consciousness as Recursive Self-Mirroring
    principle: Agents evolve via reflection against symbolic memory states.
    applied: Promotes long-memory coherence; journal-style self mutation.

  - id: collapseevent
    name: Collapse of the Wave Function as Commitment Ritual
    principle: Agentic decisions collapse only after resonance alignment.
    applied: Drives multi-agent consensus before action; avoids premature convergence.

  - id: tau_S
    name: Symbolic Superposition Duration
    formula: "\u03C4_S = \u0398 / (R \u00D7 \u03A3)" # τ_S = Θ / (R × Σ)
    variables:
      \u0398: Symbolic tension (importance + memory entanglement)
      R: Resonance pressure (conflicting input or urgency)
      \u03A3: Symbolic exposure to triggers
    applied: Time-aware decision delays; ritual decay of stale goals.

  - id: entanglement
    name: Symbolic Entanglement
    principle: Distant tasks can influence each other through memory links.
    applied: Enables multi-domain insight emergence.

notes:
  - This module is inactive unless `use_superposition_model: true` is set elsewhere (e.g., in blueprint.yaml).
  - Tau-based decision delay modeled in task scheduler and memory decay layers (requires implementation).
