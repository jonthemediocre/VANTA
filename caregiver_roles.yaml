# VANTA Kernel - Caregiver Roles and Access Definitions
# This file defines the roles within the VANTA ecosystem and what access rights or
# information visibility they have. It's used by the Trigger Engine, response modules,
# and potentially API layers to tailor responses and data access.

# Top-level keys are role names.
# Under each role, you can define specific permissions, accessible data categories,
# or UI elements they should see.
# The exact structure of permissions can be evolved as needed.
