# mutation_templates.yaml
# Defines potential mutations and their probabilities

# Example structure:

# --- Reasoning Styles --- 
potential_reasoning_styles:
  - "Layered Reflection" # Adding introspective capability
  - "Symbolic Weaving"   # Ability to connect concepts metaphorically
  - "Parallel Processing" # Exploring multiple simple ideas concurrently

add_reasoning_chance: 0.05 # Probability to attempt adding a style per cycle

# --- Communication Modes --- 
# Define direct evolution paths (Mode A can become Mode B)
communication_evolutions:
  "BREATH Framework": "WhisperMode"  # Example: Standard comms can evolve to surreal
  "WhisperMode": "Symbolic Resonance" # Example: Surreal can evolve to deeper metaphor

evolve_communication_chance: 0.02 # Probability to attempt evolving a mode per cycle

# --- Internal Parameters --- 
adjust_parameter_chance: 0.1 # Probability to attempt adjusting a parameter

# Parameter-specific adjustments (can be expanded)
parameter_adjustments:
  reflection_depth:
    range: [-1, 1]
    min_value: 1
    max_value: 5
  memory_retrieval_count:
    range: [-1, 1]
    min_value: 3
    max_value: 10

# --- New Capabilities --- 
# Example: Adding a completely new capability domain
potential_new_capabilities:
  - name: "Basic Tool Use"
    module: "tools.basic_calculator"
    add_chance: 0.01 # Very low chance initially

# --- Ritual-Specific Mutations --- 
# Mutations triggered only by specific events defined in ritual_triggers.yaml
