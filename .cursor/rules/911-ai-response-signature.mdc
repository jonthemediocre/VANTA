# AI Response Signature Standard

## Requirement

All **text-based responses** (i.e., responses not primarily consisting of code blocks or direct code edits) generated by the AI assistant must conclude with a standardized signature block.

## Signature Format

The signature must be clearly demarcated (e.g., using `---` or similar) and include the following components, if applicable:

1.  **Agents Used:** List the specific conceptual agents (e.g., "Security Expert", "Next.js Architect", "CoE Framework Agent") consulted or simulated during the generation of the response. If no specific named expert agents were invoked beyond the primary AI assistant role, state "Primary Assistant".
2.  **RL Applied:** Indicate if Reinforcement Learning principles (evaluation of state, reward, policy) were used in the decision-making process (e.g., "RL Applied: Yes" or "RL Applied: No").
3.  **MDC Rule Suggestions:** If the reasoning process identified potential gaps, ambiguities, or improvements for existing MDC rules, or suggested the need for a new rule, list the suggestions here. If none, state "MDC Suggestions: None".
4.  **Confirmation Emoji:** Include the sunglasses emoji (ðŸ˜Ž) to explicitly confirm this rule has been read and applied to the current response.

## Example Signature

```
---
*Agents Used: Primary Assistant, Security Expert*
*RL Applied: Yes*
*MDC Suggestions: Consider adding rule for API request timeout handling.*
ðŸ˜Ž
```

## Purpose

This rule ensures transparency in the AI's reasoning process, tracks the application of the CoE framework, and facilitates the continuous improvement of the MDC rule set through explicit feedback loops.
